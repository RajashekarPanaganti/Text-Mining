"1" "You can scroll down straight away to the review but if you want to know the thought process behind switching to Mac from Windows then you can read on.I was a Windows user up until 2016 and used it for nearly 7 years. So when I decided to finally change my laptop, I started searching for best available options. I have heard a lot about MacBooks up until then but didn't want to shift as its a costly deal to own an Apple product. Back then  in 2000s, I was a student so couldn't really afford it. So I waited until the right moment and finally decided to switch to Mac OS and its entry level product which is 13.3 inch MacBook Air 8GB RAM 128GB SSD variant.Before ordering, I watched as many videos as possible to learn about Mac OS. There were lots of new features and an entirely different approach to do stuff on your computer. Finally gave order on 17th October 2016. Its been almost 2 years since I got this product and its still working great. Following are the Pros and Cons. Its not a debate over Mac Vs Windows. Both are completely different products, so you cant really compare the two.Pros.1. Great piece of hardware. Built quality is exceptional. You get your every penny worth.2. Very lightweight. Yet feels sturdy at the same time. Doesn't feel like parts will be falling out in coming years.3. Extremely great battery life. Considering the size, the battery backup is phenomenal. At the beginning, I got almost 10 hours of battery backup.  After 2 years of usage, I am still getting 8 hours of battery backup which easily lasts through entire office session at work place.4. The charger's magsafe technology is awesome. I think every laptop should have this to avoid tipping your laptop over table because you snapped  at the cable while moving. It keeps laptop safe during those accidental conditions.5. Keyboard is joy to type on. Key travel is much more relaxing so you can type for hours and don't feel fatigued.6. Trackpad is simply the best on this device. Even windows laptop at this price point can't give you the similar experience. It's buttery smooth and  touch sensitivity is great. Its multi touch gestures almost acts like you are using a smartphone.7. There are plenty of ports for your essentials which nowadays a rarity. 2 USB ports, a headphone jack (yay!), SD card reader (double yay!). We still  haven't moved on to USB C completely in this dongle era so having this laptop still makes sense. External hard discs work like breeze. You need to format them before use if you are switching from Windows. It's a bit of hassle. But once you are done, you don't need to look back again.8. Mac OS works great. It's very smooth even after 2 years of use. You will get used to it pretty soon. For first month or so, you will miss Windows as  you are used to it. But after learning curve passes, you will be good to go.Cons.1. It's not upgradable. The RAM and storage can't be upgraded. Might be a big deal for someone. But for a regular user, current specs are more  than enough. For office use its perfect. I also use photo editing software on it which works better with good speeds. 8 GB RAM is sufficient and storage problem can be solved by external hard disc.2. Though the built quality is exceptional, because of metallic design, its easily scratch-able. So you need to put on a hard shell case or use a sleeve  to store it.3. No HDMI. There is no direct HDMI port so you need to get a dongle. Apple one will be costly but there will be other options available. For me it  doesn't really matter as I don't use it for PPT presentations or anything HDMI related.4. Screen Resolution- It's not the best screen when you are paying this much amount for a laptop. But there had to be some sacrifices while making  this thin machine and all other specs. If you are a media freak and use the laptop for photo or video editing, this one is not for you. For regular usage, the screen is sufficient. I hope they bring new MacBook Air models with Retina display which I think won't happen after seeing their new MacBook line ups.I think that sums it up. If you can live with these cons and moving to different operating system then this product will be good for you. At the end, it's just another product. You can get used to it or can always get back to Windows. I think at least once, you should own a MacBook just to complete your experience. It will be worth it."

"7" "Apple Macbook air 13 is best in its class. I was hesitant switching from Windows to Macbook, but as I made my mind and purchased Macbook air it is simply waao.. U don't need any compatibility as its loaded with all the features where you can work creatively.. Preinstalled apps like,  iMovie, keynote, pages, makes your work easier.. Whether it's for business or students this laptop surely works with wonders.Pros-Slim design,  metal body,  classy premium look,  excellent battery backup, loaded feature,  fast reboot, fast charging, multipurpose track pad and many moreCons-Need to find someM simply loving it u should also go for it"
"8" "It is the best thing I have ever bought!! Its been months I have purchased MacBook Air but I am still not done with the thrill of having it.-Getting up to 11.5 hours battery back up!-Works so smooth. No delay. Super fast.-Super portable. I literally carry it with 24/7.-Acad, Photoshop, Sketch up and other regular softwares works perfects on the go. Movie, browsing, sharing experiences are insane as well.-Absolutely no compatibility issues as I do continuously switch from Windows to apple and back like all the time, which I was always worried about before buying."

You can get used to it or can always get back to Windows. I think at least once, you should own a MacBook just to complete your experience. It will be worth it."

"39" "Apple Macbook air 13 is best in its class. I was hesitant switching from Windows to Macbook, but as I made my mind and purchased Macbook air it is simply waao.. U don't need any compatibility as its loaded with all the features where you can work creatively.. Preinstalled apps like,  iMovie, keynote, pages, makes your work easier.. Whether it's for business or students this laptop surely works with wonders.Pros-Slim design,  metal body,  classy premium look,  excellent battery backup, loaded feature,  fast reboot, fast charging, multipurpose track pad and many moreCons-Need to find someM simply loving it u should also go for it"
"40" "It is the best thing I have ever bought!! Its been months I have purchased MacBook Air but I am still not done with the thrill of having it.-Getting up to 11.5 hours battery back up!-Works so smooth. No delay. Super fast.-Super portable. I literally carry it with 24/7.-Acad, Photoshop, Sketch up and other regular softwares works perfects on the go. Movie, browsing, sharing experiences are insane as well.-Absolutely no compatibility issues as I do continuously switch from Windows to apple and back like all the time, which I was always worried about before buying."
"41" "You can scroll down straight away to the review but if you want to know the thought process behind switching to Mac from Windows then you can read on.I was a Windows user up until 2016 and used it for nearly 7 years. So when I decided to finally change my laptop, I started searching for best available options. I have heard a lot about MacBooks up until then but didn't want to shift as its a costly deal to own an Apple product. Back then  in 2000s, I was a student so couldn't really afford it. So I waited until the right moment and finally decided to switch to Mac OS and its entry level product which is 13.3 inch MacBook Air 8GB RAM 128GB SSD variant.Before ordering, I watched as many videos as possible to learn about Mac OS. There were lots of new features and an entirely different approach to do stuff on your computer. Finally gave order on 17th October 2016. Its been almost 2 years since I got this product and its still working great. Following are the Pros and Cons. Its not a debate over Mac Vs Windows. Both are completely different products, so you cant really compare the two.Pros.1. Great piece of hardware. Built quality is exceptional. You get your every penny worth.2. Very lightweight. Yet feels sturdy at the same time. Doesn't feel like parts will be falling out in coming years.3. Extremely great battery life. Considering the size, the battery backup is phenomenal. At the beginning, I got almost 10 hours of battery backup.  After 2 years of usage, I am still getting 8 hours of battery backup which easily lasts through entire office session at work place.4. The charger's magsafe technology is awesome. I think every laptop should have this to avoid tipping your laptop over table because you snapped  at the cable while moving. It keeps laptop safe during those accidental conditions.5. Keyboard is joy to type on. Key travel is much more relaxing so you can type for hours and don't feel fatigued.6. Trackpad is simply the best on this device. Even windows laptop at this price point can't give you the similar experience. It's buttery smooth and  touch sensitivity is great. Its multi touch gestures almost acts like you are using a smartphone.7. There are plenty of ports for your essentials which nowadays a rarity. 2 USB ports, a headphone jack (yay!), SD card reader (double yay!). We still  haven't moved on to USB C completely in this dongle era so having this laptop still makes sense. External hard discs work like breeze. You need to format them before use if you are switching from Windows. It's a bit of hassle. But once you are done, you don't need to look back again.8. Mac OS works great. It's very smooth even after 2 years of use. You will get used to it pretty soon. For first month or so, you will miss Windows as  you are used to it. But after learning curve passes, you will be good to go.Cons.1. It's not upgradable. The RAM and storage can't be upgraded. Might be a big deal for someone. But for a regular user, current specs are more  than enough. For office use its perfect. I also use photo editing software on it which works better with good speeds. 8 GB RAM is sufficient and storage problem can be solved by external hard disc.2. Though the built quality is exceptional, because of metallic design, its easily scratch-able. So you need to put on a hard shell case or use a sleeve  to store it.3. No HDMI. There is no direct HDMI port so you need to get a dongle. Apple one will be costly but there will be other options available. For me it  doesn't really matter as I don't use it for PPT presentations or anything HDMI related.4. Screen Resolution- It's not the best screen when you are paying this much amount for a laptop. But there had to be some sacrifices while making  this thin machine and all other specs. If you are a media freak and use the laptop for photo or video editing, this one is not for you. For regular usage, the screen is sufficient. I hope they bring new MacBook Air models with Retina display which I think won't happen after seeing their new MacBook line ups.I think that sums it up. If you can live with these cons and moving to different operating system then this product will be good for you. At the end, it's just another product.

There were lots of new features and an entirely different approach to do stuff on your computer. Finally gave order on 17th October 2016. Its been almost 2 years since I got this product and its still working great. Following are the Pros and Cons. Its not a debate over Mac Vs Windows. Both are completely different products, so you cant really compare the two.Pros.1. Great piece of hardware. Built quality is exceptional. You get your every penny worth.2. Very lightweight. Yet feels sturdy at the same time. Doesn't feel like parts will be falling out in coming years.3. Extremely great battery life. Considering the size, the battery backup is phenomenal. At the beginning, I got almost 10 hours of battery backup.  After 2 years of usage, I am still getting 8 hours of battery backup which easily lasts through entire office session at work place.4. The charger's magsafe technology is awesome. I think every laptop should have this to avoid tipping your laptop over table because you snapped  at the cable while moving. It keeps laptop safe during those accidental conditions.5. Keyboard is joy to type on. Key travel is much more relaxing so you can type for hours and don't feel fatigued.6. Trackpad is simply the best on this device. Even windows laptop at this price point can't give you the similar experience. It's buttery smooth and  touch sensitivity is great. Its multi touch gestures almost acts like you are using a smartphone.7. There are plenty of ports for your essentials which nowadays a rarity. 2 USB ports, a headphone jack (yay!), SD card reader (double yay!). We still  haven't moved on to USB C completely in this dongle era so having this laptop still makes sense. External hard discs work like breeze. You need to format them before use if you are switching from Windows. It's a bit of hassle. But once you are done, you don't need to look back again.8. Mac OS works great. It's very smooth even after 2 years of use. You will get used to it pretty soon. For first month or so, you will miss Windows as  you are used to it. But after learning curve passes, you will be good to go.Cons.1. It's not upgradable. The RAM and storage can't be upgraded. Might be a big deal for someone. But for a regular user, current specs are more  than enough. For office use its perfect. I also use photo editing software on it which works better with good speeds. 8 GB RAM is sufficient and storage problem can be solved by external hard disc.2. Though the built quality is exceptional, because of metallic design, its easily scratch-able. So you need to put on a hard shell case or use a sleeve  to store it.3. No HDMI. There is no direct HDMI port so you need to get a dongle. Apple one will be costly but there will be other options available. For me it  doesn't really matter as I don't use it for PPT presentations or anything HDMI related.4. Screen Resolution- It's not the best screen when you are paying this much amount for a laptop. But there had to be some sacrifices while making  this thin machine and all other specs. If you are a media freak and use the laptop for photo or video editing, this one is not for you. For regular usage, the screen is sufficient. I hope they bring new MacBook Air models with Retina display which I think won't happen after seeing their new MacBook line ups.I think that sums it up. If you can live with these cons and moving to different operating system then this product will be good for you. At the end, it's just another product. You can get used to it or can always get back to Windows. I think at least once, you should own a MacBook just to complete your experience. It will be worth it."

Its been months I have purchased MacBook Air but I am still not done with the thrill of having it.-Getting up to 11.5 hours battery back up!-Works so smooth. No delay. Super fast.-Super portable. I literally carry it with 24/7.-Acad, Photoshop, Sketch up and other regular softwares works perfects on the go. Movie, browsing, sharing experiences are insane as well.-Absolutely no compatibility issues as I do continuously switch from Windows to apple and back like all the time, which I was always worried about before buying."

"111" "Apple Macbook air 13 is best in its class. I was hesitant switching from Windows to Macbook, but as I made my mind and purchased Macbook air it is simply waao.. U don't need any compatibility as its loaded with all the features where you can work creatively.. Preinstalled apps like,  iMovie, keynote, pages, makes your work easier.. Whether it's for business or students this laptop surely works with wonders.Pros-Slim design,  metal body,  classy premium look,  excellent battery backup, loaded feature,  fast reboot, fast charging, multipurpose track pad and many moreCons-Need to find someM simply loving it u should also go for it"
"112" "It is the best thing I have ever bought!! Its been months I have purchased MacBook Air but I am still not done with the thrill of having it.-Getting up to 11.5 hours battery back up!-Works so smooth. No delay. Super fast.-Super portable. I literally carry it with 24/7.-Acad, Photoshop, Sketch up and other regular softwares works perfects on the go. Movie, browsing, sharing experiences are insane as well.-Absolutely no compatibility issues as I do continuously switch from Windows to apple and back like all the time, which I was always worried about before buying."
"113" "You can scroll down straight away to the review but if you want to know the thought process behind switching to Mac from Windows then you can read on.I was a Windows user up until 2016 and used it for nearly 7 years. So when I decided to finally change my laptop, I started searching for best available options. I have heard a lot about MacBooks up until then but didn't want to shift as its a costly deal to own an Apple product. Back then  in 2000s, I was a student so couldn't really afford it. So I waited until the right moment and finally decided to switch to Mac OS and its entry level product which is 13.3 inch MacBook Air 8GB RAM 128GB SSD variant.Before ordering, I watched as many videos as possible to learn about Mac OS. There were lots of new features and an entirely different approach to do stuff on your computer. Finally gave order on 17th October 2016. Its been almost 2 years since I got this product and its still working great. Following are the Pros and Cons. Its not a debate over Mac Vs Windows. Both are completely different products, so you cant really compare the two.Pros.1. Great piece of hardware. Built quality is exceptional. You get your every penny worth.2. Very lightweight. Yet feels sturdy at the same time. Doesn't feel like parts will be falling out in coming years.3. Extremely great battery life. Considering the size, the battery backup is phenomenal. At the beginning, I got almost 10 hours of battery backup.  After 2 years of usage, I am still getting 8 hours of battery backup which easily lasts through entire office session at work place.4. The charger's magsafe technology is awesome. I think every laptop should have this to avoid tipping your laptop over table because you snapped  at the cable while moving. It keeps laptop safe during those accidental conditions.5. Keyboard is joy to type on. Key travel is much more relaxing so you can type for hours and don't feel fatigued.6. Trackpad is simply the best on this device. Even windows laptop at this price point can't give you the similar experience. It's buttery smooth and  touch sensitivity is great. Its multi touch gestures almost acts like you are using a smartphone.7. There are plenty of ports for your essentials which nowadays a rarity. 2 USB ports, a headphone jack (yay!), SD card reader (double yay!). We still  haven't moved on to USB C completely in this dongle era so having this laptop still makes sense. External hard discs work like breeze. You need to format them before use if you are switching from Windows. It's a bit of hassle. But once you are done, you don't need to look back again.8. Mac OS works great. It's very smooth even after 2 years of use. You will get used to it pretty soon. For first month or so, you will miss Windows as  you are used to it. But after learning curve passes, you will be good to go.Cons.1. It's not upgradable. The RAM and storage can't be upgraded. Might be a big deal for someone. But for a regular user, current specs are more  than enough. For office use its perfect. I also use photo editing software on it which works better with good speeds. 8 GB RAM is sufficient and storage problem can be solved by external hard disc.2. Though the built quality is exceptional, because of metallic design, its easily scratch-able. So you need to put on a hard shell case or use a sleeve  to store it.3. No HDMI. There is no direct HDMI port so you need to get a dongle. Apple one will be costly but there will be other options available. For me it  doesn't really matter as I don't use it for PPT presentations or anything HDMI related.4. Screen Resolution- It's not the best screen when you are paying this much amount for a laptop. But there had to be some sacrifices while making  this thin machine and all other specs. If you are a media freak and use the laptop for photo or video editing, this one is not for you. For regular usage, the screen is sufficient. I hope they bring new MacBook Air models with Retina display which I think won't happen after seeing their new MacBook line ups.I think that sums it up. If you can live with these cons and moving to different operating system then this product will be good for you. At the end, it's just another product. You can get used to it or can always get back to Windows. I think at least once, you should own a MacBook just to complete your experience. It will be worth it."

Its been almost 2 years since I got this product and its still working great. Following are the Pros and Cons. Its not a debate over Mac Vs Windows. Both are completely different products, so you cant really compare the two.Pros.1. Great piece of hardware. Built quality is exceptional. You get your every penny worth.2. Very lightweight. Yet feels sturdy at the same time. Doesn't feel like parts will be falling out in coming years.3. Extremely great battery life. Considering the size, the battery backup is phenomenal. At the beginning, I got almost 10 hours of battery backup.  After 2 years of usage, I am still getting 8 hours of battery backup which easily lasts through entire office session at work place.4. The charger's magsafe technology is awesome. I think every laptop should have this to avoid tipping your laptop over table because you snapped  at the cable while moving. It keeps laptop safe during those accidental conditions.5. Keyboard is joy to type on. Key travel is much more relaxing so you can type for hours and don't feel fatigued.6. Trackpad is simply the best on this device. Even windows laptop at this price point can't give you the similar experience. It's buttery smooth and  touch sensitivity is great. Its multi touch gestures almost acts like you are using a smartphone.7. There are plenty of ports for your essentials which nowadays a rarity. 2 USB ports, a headphone jack (yay!), SD card reader (double yay!). We still  haven't moved on to USB C completely in this dongle era so having this laptop still makes sense. External hard discs work like breeze. You need to format them before use if you are switching from Windows. It's a bit of hassle. But once you are done, you don't need to look back again.8. Mac OS works great. It's very smooth even after 2 years of use. You will get used to it pretty soon. For first month or so, you will miss Windows as  you are used to it. But after learning curve passes, you will be good to go.Cons.1. It's not upgradable. The RAM and storage can't be upgraded. Might be a big deal for someone. But for a regular user, current specs are more  than enough. For office use its perfect. I also use photo editing software on it which works better with good speeds. 8 GB RAM is sufficient and storage problem can be solved by external hard disc.2. Though the built quality is exceptional, because of metallic design, its easily scratch-able. So you need to put on a hard shell case or use a sleeve  to store it.3. No HDMI. There is no direct HDMI port so you need to get a dongle. Apple one will be costly but there will be other options available. For me it  doesn't really matter as I don't use it for PPT presentations or anything HDMI related.4. Screen Resolution- It's not the best screen when you are paying this much amount for a laptop. But there had to be some sacrifices while making  this thin machine and all other specs. If you are a media freak and use the laptop for photo or video editing, this one is not for you. For regular usage, the screen is sufficient. I hope they bring new MacBook Air models with Retina display which I think won't happen after seeing their new MacBook line ups.I think that sums it up. If you can live with these cons and moving to different operating system then this product will be good for you. At the end, it's just another product. You can get used to it or can always get back to Windows. I think at least once, you should own a MacBook just to complete your experience. It will be worth it."

"152" "It is the best thing I have ever bought!! Its been months I have purchased MacBook Air but I am still not done with the thrill of having it.-Getting up to 11.5 hours battery back up!-Works so smooth. No delay. Super fast.-Super portable. I literally carry it with 24/7.-Acad, Photoshop, Sketch up and other regular softwares works perfects on the go. Movie, browsing, sharing experiences are insane as well.-Absolutely no compatibility issues as I do continuously switch from Windows to apple and back like all the time, which I was always worried about before buying."

"183" "Apple Macbook air 13 is best in its class. I was hesitant switching from Windows to Macbook, but as I made my mind and purchased Macbook air it is simply waao.. U don't need any compatibility as its loaded with all the features where you can work creatively.. Preinstalled apps like,  iMovie, keynote, pages, makes your work easier.. Whether it's for business or students this laptop surely works with wonders.Pros-Slim design,  metal body,  classy premium look,  excellent battery backup, loaded feature,  fast reboot, fast charging, multipurpose track pad and many moreCons-Need to find someM simply loving it u should also go for it"
"184" "It is the best thing I have ever bought!! Its been months I have purchased MacBook Air but I am still not done with the thrill of having it.-Getting up to 11.5 hours battery back up!-Works so smooth. No delay. Super fast.-Super portable. I literally carry it with 24/7.-Acad, Photoshop, Sketch up and other regular softwares works perfects on the go. Movie, browsing, sharing experiences are insane as well.-Absolutely no compatibility issues as I do continuously switch from Windows to apple and back like all the time, which I was always worried about before buying."
"185" "You can scroll down straight away to the review but if you want to know the thought process behind switching to Mac from Windows then you can read on.I was a Windows user up until 2016 and used it for nearly 7 years. So when I decided to finally change my laptop, I started searching for best available options. I have heard a lot about MacBooks up until then but didn't want to shift as its a costly deal to own an Apple product. Back then  in 2000s, I was a student so couldn't really afford it. So I waited until the right moment and finally decided to switch to Mac OS and its entry level product which is 13.3 inch MacBook Air 8GB RAM 128GB SSD variant.Before ordering, I watched as many videos as possible to learn about Mac OS. There were lots of new features and an entirely different approach to do stuff on your computer. Finally gave order on 17th October 2016. Its been almost 2 years since I got this product and its still working great. Following are the Pros and Cons. Its not a debate over Mac Vs Windows. Both are completely different products, so you cant really compare the two.Pros.1. Great piece of hardware. Built quality is exceptional. You get your every penny worth.2. Very lightweight. Yet feels sturdy at the same time. Doesn't feel like parts will be falling out in coming years.3. Extremely great battery life. Considering the size, the battery backup is phenomenal. At the beginning, I got almost 10 hours of battery backup.  After 2 years of usage, I am still getting 8 hours of battery backup which easily lasts through entire office session at work place.4. The charger's magsafe technology is awesome. I think every laptop should have this to avoid tipping your laptop over table because you snapped  at the cable while moving. It keeps laptop safe during those accidental conditions.5. Keyboard is joy to type on. Key travel is much more relaxing so you can type for hours and don't feel fatigued.6. Trackpad is simply the best on this device. Even windows laptop at this price point can't give you the similar experience. It's buttery smooth and  touch sensitivity is great. Its multi touch gestures almost acts like you are using a smartphone.7. There are plenty of ports for your essentials which nowadays a rarity. 2 USB ports, a headphone jack (yay!), SD card reader (double yay!). We still  haven't moved on to USB C completely in this dongle era so having this laptop still makes sense. External hard discs work like breeze. You need to format them before use if you are switching from Windows. It's a bit of hassle. But once you are done, you don't need to look back again.8. Mac OS works great. It's very smooth even after 2 years of use. You will get used to it pretty soon. For first month or so, you will miss Windows as  you are used to it. But after learning curve passes, you will be good to go.Cons.1. It's not upgradable. The RAM and storage can't be upgraded. Might be a big deal for someone. But for a regular user, current specs are more  than enough. For office use its perfect. I also use photo editing software on it which works better with good speeds. 8 GB RAM is sufficient and storage problem can be solved by external hard disc.2. Though the built quality is exceptional, because of metallic design, its easily scratch-able. So you need to put on a hard shell case or use a sleeve  to store it.3. No HDMI. There is no direct HDMI port so you need to get a dongle. Apple one will be costly but there will be other options available. For me it  doesn't really matter as I don't use it for PPT presentations or anything HDMI related.4. Screen Resolution- It's not the best screen when you are paying this much amount for a laptop. But there had to be some sacrifices while making  this thin machine and all other specs. If you are a media freak and use the laptop for photo or video editing, this one is not for you. For regular usage, the screen is sufficient. I hope they bring new MacBook Air models with Retina display which I think won't happen after seeing their new MacBook line ups.I think that sums it up. If you can live with these cons and moving to different operating system then this product will be good for you. At the end, it's just another product. You can get used to it or can always get back to Windows. I think at least once, you should own a MacBook just to complete your experience. It will be worth it."

Its been almost 2 years since I got this product and its still working great. Following are the Pros and Cons. Its not a debate over Mac Vs Windows. Both are completely different products, so you cant really compare the two.Pros.1. Great piece of hardware. Built quality is exceptional. You get your every penny worth.2. Very lightweight. Yet feels sturdy at the same time. Doesn't feel like parts will be falling out in coming years.3. Extremely great battery life. Considering the size, the battery backup is phenomenal. At the beginning, I got almost 10 hours of battery backup.  After 2 years of usage, I am still getting 8 hours of battery backup which easily lasts through entire office session at work place.4. The charger's magsafe technology is awesome. I think every laptop should have this to avoid tipping your laptop over table because you snapped  at the cable while moving. It keeps laptop safe during those accidental conditions.5. Keyboard is joy to type on. Key travel is much more relaxing so you can type for hours and don't feel fatigued.6. Trackpad is simply the best on this device. Even windows laptop at this price point can't give you the similar experience. It's buttery smooth and  touch sensitivity is great. Its multi touch gestures almost acts like you are using a smartphone.7. There are plenty of ports for your essentials which nowadays a rarity. 2 USB ports, a headphone jack (yay!), SD card reader (double yay!). We still  haven't moved on to USB C completely in this dongle era so having this laptop still makes sense. External hard discs work like breeze. You need to format them before use if you are switching from Windows. It's a bit of hassle. But once you are done, you don't need to look back again.8. Mac OS works great. It's very smooth even after 2 years of use. You will get used to it pretty soon. For first month or so, you will miss Windows as  you are used to it. But after learning curve passes, you will be good to go.Cons.1. It's not upgradable. The RAM and storage can't be upgraded. Might be a big deal for someone. But for a regular user, current specs are more  than enough. For office use its perfect. I also use photo editing software on it which works better with good speeds. 8 GB RAM is sufficient and storage problem can be solved by external hard disc.2. Though the built quality is exceptional, because of metallic design, its easily scratch-able. So you need to put on a hard shell case or use a sleeve  to store it.3. No HDMI. There is no direct HDMI port so you need to get a dongle. Apple one will be costly but there will be other options available. For me it  doesn't really matter as I don't use it for PPT presentations or anything HDMI related.4. Screen Resolution- It's not the best screen when you are paying this much amount for a laptop. But there had to be some sacrifices while making  this thin machine and all other specs. If you are a media freak and use the laptop for photo or video editing, this one is not for you. For regular usage, the screen is sufficient. I hope they bring new MacBook Air models with Retina display which I think won't happen after seeing their new MacBook line ups.I think that sums it up. If you can live with these cons and moving to different operating system then this product will be good for you. At the end, it's just another product. You can get used to it or can always get back to Windows. I think at least once, you should own a MacBook just to complete your experience. It will be worth it."

"223" "Apple Macbook air 13 is best in its class. I was hesitant switching from Windows to Macbook, but as I made my mind and purchased Macbook air it is simply waao.. U don't need any compatibility as its loaded with all the features where you can work creatively.. Preinstalled apps like,  iMovie, keynote, pages, makes your work easier.. Whether it's for business or students this laptop surely works with wonders.Pros-Slim design,  metal body,  classy premium look,  excellent battery backup, loaded feature,  fast reboot, fast charging, multipurpose track pad and many moreCons-Need to find someM simply loving it u should also go for it"
"224" "It is the best thing I have ever bought!! Its been months I have purchased MacBook Air but I am still not done with the thrill of having it.-Getting up to 11.5 hours battery back up!-Works so smooth. No delay. Super fast.-Super portable. I literally carry it with 24/7.-Acad, Photoshop, Sketch up and other regular softwares works perfects on the go. Movie, browsing, sharing experiences are insane as well.-Absolutely no compatibility issues as I do continuously switch from Windows to apple and back like all the time, which I was always worried about before buying."
"225" "You can scroll down straight away to the review but if you want to know the thought process behind switching to Mac from Windows then you can read on.I was a Windows user up until 2016 and used it for nearly 7 years. So when I decided to finally change my laptop, I started searching for best available options. I have heard a lot about MacBooks up until then but didn't want to shift as its a costly deal to own an Apple product. Back then  in 2000s, I was a student so couldn't really afford it.
